# PRD: Dynamic Role-Based Navigation System for Gravitycar Framework

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version

* PRD: Dynamic Role-Based Navigation System for Gravitycar Framework
* Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

The Dynamic Role-Based Navigation System will replace the current hardcoded navigation in the Gravitycar Framework with an intelligent, permission-aware navigation system. This system will automatically discover available models and features, filter them based on user permissions, and present a clean hierarchical navigation interface that adapts to the user's role and available actions.

The system consists of two main components: a Backend Navigation Service that provides role-appropriate navigation data via a cached JSON API, and a Frontend Navigation Component that renders a vertical sidebar navigation with model links and create sub-options. This solution eliminates manual navigation maintenance while ensuring users only see links they have permission to access.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals

* Eliminate manual navigation maintenance when adding new models or features to the framework
* Improve security by ensuring users never see navigation items they cannot access
* Reduce development overhead by auto-discovering navigation items from existing metadata
* Provide consistent user experience across different user roles and permission levels
* Enable rapid feature deployment without requiring navigation updates

### 2.2 User goals

* Access only the features and models they have permission to use
* Easily discover available create functionality for each model
* Navigate efficiently between model list views and creation forms
* Understand their access level through clear visual indicators
* Experience fast navigation loading through intelligent caching

### 2.3 Non-goals

* This system will not modify the existing RBAC permission system
* Will not replace individual page authorization - only navigation visibility
* Will not provide navigation for non-web interfaces (API-only usage)
* Will not handle complex nested hierarchies beyond model â†’ actions structure

## 3. User personas

### 3.1 Key user types

* Framework administrators managing system configuration
* Content managers working with multiple models daily
* Regular users with limited permissions accessing specific features
* Developers adding new models and features to the framework

### 3.2 Basic persona details

* **System Administrator**: Full access to all models and actions, needs comprehensive navigation to manage the entire system efficiently
* **Content Manager**: Access to most models with create/read/update permissions, requires quick access to frequently used features
* **Regular User**: Limited access to specific models, typically read-only with some create permissions, needs simple focused navigation
* **Developer**: Technical user who adds new models and needs navigation to auto-update without manual configuration

### 3.3 Role-based access

* **Admin Role**: Full navigation access to all discovered models and custom pages with all available actions
* **Manager Role**: Access to business-relevant models with standard CRUD operations, excluded from system administration features
* **User Role**: Access to content consumption and creation features, limited administrative capabilities
* **Guest Role**: Minimal navigation showing only public or registration-related features

## 4. Functional requirements

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights

* Clean vertical sidebar design that complements existing Gravitycar UI
* Click-to-expand model sections with create sub-options when permitted
* Single menu expansion - clicking a model collapses any previously open menu
* Clear visual distinction between models and custom pages
* Consistent styling with existing framework design system
* Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet interfaces

## 6. Narrative

When users log into the Gravitycar Framework, they are immediately presented with a clean, intuitive navigation sidebar that shows exactly what they can access based on their role and permissions. Instead of static links that may lead to permission errors, the dynamic navigation system intelligently discovers all available models and features, checks the user's permissions against the RBAC system, and presents only relevant options. Users can click on model names to navigate to list views, and see a create sub-option when they have create permissions, making their capabilities immediately clear. As the system grows with new models and features, the navigation automatically updates without requiring manual maintenance, ensuring users always have access to new functionality they're authorized to use.
