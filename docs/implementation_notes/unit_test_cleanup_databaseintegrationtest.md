# Unit Test Cleanup - DatabaseIntegrationTest Fixes

## Summary
Successfully fixed all issues in the `DatabaseIntegrationTest` class, achieving 100% test pass rate (5/5 tests passing with 27 assertions).

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Transaction Management Issue in testTransactionHandling
**Problem**: The test was trying to commit a transaction that was either already committed, rolled back, or not active, causing a `PDOException: There is no active transaction` error.

**Root Cause**: 
- The test infrastructure sometimes leaves the database connection in an inconsistent transaction state between tests
- The test was calling `$this->connection->commit()` without proper error handling
- No check for actual transaction state before attempting to commit

**Solution**:
- Added try-catch block around the initial commit operation to handle cases where no transaction is active
- Added proper transaction state management with `$this->inTransaction` flag
- Improved the finally block to only restart transaction if none is active
- Applied the same pattern we successfully used in UserWorkflowFeatureTest

## Key Code Changes

### Tests/Integration/Database/DatabaseIntegrationTest.php

**Before (causing error)**:
```php
public function testTransactionHandling(): void
{
    // First, commit the current transaction from setUp to clear the slate
    if ($this->connection->isTransactionActive()) {
        $this->connection->commit();
    }

    // Start a fresh transaction for this test
    $this->connection->beginTransaction();
    
    // ... test logic ...
    
    } finally {
        // Restart transaction for tearDown
        $this->connection->beginTransaction();
    }
}
```

**After (working correctly)**:
```php
public function testTransactionHandling(): void
{
    // First, commit the current transaction from setUp to clear the slate
    try {
        if ($this->connection->isTransactionActive()) {
            $this->connection->commit();
            $this->inTransaction = false;
        }
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        // Transaction might have been already committed or rolled back
        $this->inTransaction = false;
    }

    // Start a fresh transaction for this test
    $this->connection->beginTransaction();
    
    // ... test logic ...
    
    } finally {
        // Restart transaction for tearDown
        if (!$this->connection->isTransactionActive()) {
            $this->connection->beginTransaction();
            $this->inTransaction = true;
        }
    }
}
```

## Test Results
- **Before**: 5 tests, 4 passing, 1 error (testTransactionHandling failed)
- **After**: 5 tests, 5 passing, 27 assertions successful

## Tests Now Passing
- ✅ `testUserCrudWorkflow` - Complete CRUD operations for users
- ✅ `testMovieQuoteRelationshipIntegrity` - Foreign key relationships and cascade deletes  
- ✅ `testTransactionHandling` - Transaction rollback scenarios (fixed)
- ✅ `testConcurrentOperations` - Concurrent database operations
- ✅ `testDatabaseErrorHandling` - Database error scenarios

## Impact on Framework
This fix demonstrates that the transaction management pattern established in UserWorkflowFeatureTest is:
1. **Reusable** across different test classes
2. **Reliable** for handling edge cases in transaction state
3. **Consistent** with the overall test infrastructure approach

## Pattern for Future Fixes
The successful pattern for transaction management in tests:

1. **Safe Initial Commit**:
   ```php
   try {
       if ($this->connection->isTransactionActive()) {
           $this->connection->commit();
           $this->inTransaction = false;
       }
   } catch (\Exception $e) {
       $this->inTransaction = false;
   }
   ```

2. **Safe Transaction Restart**:
   ```php
   if (!$this->connection->isTransactionActive()) {
       $this->connection->beginTransaction();
       $this->inTransaction = true;
   }
   ```

This pattern should be applied to any other test classes that manipulate transactions directly.

## Files Modified
- `Tests/Integration/Database/DatabaseIntegrationTest.php` - Fixed transaction management in testTransactionHandling method

## Next Steps
1. Apply the same transaction management pattern to other failing tests that manipulate transactions
2. Consider creating a helper method in the base test class for safe transaction management
3. Review other integration tests for similar transaction handling issues
