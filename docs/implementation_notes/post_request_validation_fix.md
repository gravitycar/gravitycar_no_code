# POST Request Fix for New Records

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: POST requests were not being sent when creating new records through the frontend forms. The forms appeared to submit but no HTTP request was made to the backend.

**Symptom**: Users could edit existing records (PUT requests worked), but creating new records failed silently.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the form validation logic. Here's what was happening:

1. **Users metadata includes an `id` field** with these properties:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "id",
     "type": "ID",
     "required": true,
     "readOnly": true,
     "isPrimaryKey": true
   }
   ```

2. **Form validation was checking ALL required fields**, including the `id` field

3. **For new records, the `id` field is empty** (it gets auto-generated by the backend)

4. **Validation failed** because the required `id` field was empty

5. **Form submission was prevented** before any HTTP request could be made

## The Fix

Modified the `validateForm()` function in `ModelForm.tsx` to skip validation for `readOnly` fields when creating new records:

```typescript
// Skip validation for readOnly fields when creating new records (they'll be auto-generated)
if (!recordId && field.readOnly) {
  return;
}
```

## Logic Explanation

- `!recordId` → We're creating a new record (not editing)
- `field.readOnly` → The field is marked as read-only in metadata
- Combined: Skip validation for read-only fields during creation

This makes sense because:
- Read-only fields like `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` are auto-generated by the backend
- They shouldn't be validated on the frontend for new records
- They should still be validated for existing records to ensure data integrity

## Technical Flow

### Before Fix:
```
User fills form → Validation fails on empty 'id' → Form doesn't submit → No HTTP request
```

### After Fix:
```
User fills form → Validation skips readOnly fields → Form submits → POST request sent → Record created
```

## HTTP Method Verification

The fix resolves the POST issue. The complete HTTP method flow now works correctly:

- **CREATE**: `ModelForm` (no recordId) → `apiService.create()` → **POST** `/Users`
- **UPDATE**: `ModelForm` (with recordId) → `apiService.update()` → **PUT** `/Users/{id}`
- **DELETE**: `GenericCrudPage` → `apiService.delete()` → **DELETE** `/Users/{id}`

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/forms/ModelForm.tsx`**
   - Updated `validateForm()` to skip readOnly fields for new records
   - This allows forms to pass validation and submit properly

## Testing Verification

- ✅ Backend API accepts POST requests (verified with curl)
- ✅ Frontend form validation now passes for new records
- ✅ POST requests are sent to the backend when creating new records
- ✅ PUT requests continue to work for updating existing records

## Impact

This fix ensures that the unified CRUD system works correctly for all operations:
- Users can now create new records successfully
- All models (Users, Movies, Movie Quotes) benefit from this fix
- The metadata-driven architecture works as intended

The issue was subtle because the validation failure happened before any network request, making it appear as if the frontend wasn't sending POST requests when in fact it was preventing form submission entirely.
