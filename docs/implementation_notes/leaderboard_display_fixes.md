# Leaderboard Display Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **NaN% accuracy display**: API doesn't provide detailed game statistics (correctAnswers, totalQuestions)
2. **NaN:NaN time display**: API doesn't provide timeElapsed data
3. **Invalid Date timestamps**: Date field name mismatch (`game_completed_at` vs `dateCompleted`)
4. **Incorrect sorting**: Leaderboard wasn't sorted by score in descending order
5. **Field name mismatches**: API returns different field names than frontend expects

## API Response Analysis
The `/trivia/high-scores` endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "name": "Guest User's game played on September 6, 2025",
  "score": 203,
  "game_completed_at": "2025-09-06 21:20:02", 
  "created_by_name": "Guest User guest@gravitycar.com"
}
```

But the frontend expected fields like:
- `playerName`, `correctAnswers`, `totalQuestions`, `timeElapsed`, `dateCompleted`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated useGameState.ts - fetchHighScores()
- **Added sorting**: Sort scores by score in descending order using `b.score - a.score`
- **Fixed field mapping**: Map `created_by_name` to `playerName`
- **Fixed date handling**: Convert `game_completed_at` to formatted date string
- **Handled missing data**: Set accuracy, totalQuestions, correctAnswers, timeElapsed to 0 instead of undefined

### 2. Updated TriviaHighScores.tsx
- **Removed unavailable stats**: Removed accuracy, correct answers, and time displays from leaderboard rows
- **Simplified stats summary**: Changed "Average Accuracy" to "Average Score" 
- **Cleaned up unused code**: Removed unused `formatTime` function and `TriviaHighScore` import

### 3. Layout Changes
- **Score-only display**: Leaderboard now shows only player name, date, and score
- **Clean statistics**: Summary shows highest score, average score, and total games
- **Proper sorting**: Highest scores appear at the top

## Result
- ✅ Leaderboard properly sorted by score (highest first)
- ✅ No more "NaN%" or "NaN:NaN" displays  
- ✅ Valid date formatting (e.g., "9/6/2025")
- ✅ Clean, focused display showing available data only
- ✅ Proper player name extraction from API response

## Files Modified
- `/gravitycar-frontend/src/hooks/useGameState.ts`
- `/gravitycar-frontend/src/components/trivia/TriviaHighScores.tsx`

## Testing
Data transformation verified with actual API response format, sorting works correctly (203, 170, 100 order confirmed).
