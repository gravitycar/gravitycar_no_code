# SchemaGeneratorIntegrationTest Fix - Implementation Notes

## Issue Resolved
Fixed persistent test failures in `SchemaGeneratorIntegrationTest` where individual tests would pass but batch test runs would fail with database connection errors.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by the ServiceLocator caching DatabaseConnector instances between tests. Here's what was happening:

1. **Test Setup**: Each test creates a unique test database name and updates the config
2. **ServiceLocator Caching**: SchemaGenerator uses `ServiceLocator::getDatabaseConnector()` to get its DatabaseConnector instance
3. **Stale Cache**: The cached DatabaseConnector retained database parameters from previous tests
4. **Connection Failure**: When tests tried to access the database, they were connecting to databases that were already dropped by previous test teardowns

## Solution Implemented
Added `ServiceLocator::reset()` call to the test's `setUp()` method to clear all cached service instances before each test runs:

```php
protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();
    
    // Reset ServiceLocator to clear any cached instances
    ServiceLocator::reset();
    
    // ... rest of setup
}
```

## Key Changes Made

### 1. DatabaseConnector Connection Reset
Added a `resetConnection()` method to DatabaseConnector and modified `createDatabaseIfNotExists()` to reset the connection after database creation:

```php
public function resetConnection(): void {
    if ($this->connection !== null) {
        $this->connection->close();
        $this->connection = null;
    }
}
```

### 2. Test Database Creation in setUp
Moved database creation to setUp method to ensure all tests start with a fresh database:

```php
// Create test database in setUp to avoid connection errors
$this->schemaGenerator->createDatabaseIfNotExists();
```

### 3. Removed Duplicate Database Creation
Removed redundant `createDatabaseIfNotExists()` calls from individual test methods since it's now handled in setUp.

## Test Results
- **Before Fix**: `Tests: 7, Assertions: 26, Errors: 2, Failures: 2`
- **After Fix**: `Tests: 7, Assertions: 79, Errors: 0, Failures: 0` âœ…

## Technical Lessons
1. **Service Caching**: Be aware of service locator caching when changing configuration in tests
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test should start with a clean state, especially for integration tests
3. **Connection Management**: Database connections can become stale when configuration changes
4. **Debugging Pattern**: Individual tests passing but batch runs failing often indicates shared state issues

## Files Modified
- `Tests/Integration/Schema/SchemaGeneratorIntegrationTest.php` - Added ServiceLocator reset and improved test setup
- `src/Database/DatabaseConnector.php` - Added connection reset capability

## Verification
All SchemaGeneratorIntegrationTest tests now pass consistently in both individual and batch execution modes.
