# ModelBase::getRelatedModels() Method Update

**Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Overview

Updated the `ModelBase::getRelatedModels()` method to properly handle relationship table records and retrieve actual related model instances using the new relationship-aware functionality.

## Problem Addressed

The previous implementation was incorrectly treating relationship table records as if they were the actual related model records. For example, when calling `$movie->getRelatedModels('movies_movie_quotes')`, it was trying to populate Movie_Quote model instances with data from the `rel_1_movies_M_movie_quotes` join table instead of retrieving the actual movie quote records.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated Method Logic

1. **Get Relationship Records**: Call `getRelated()` to get records from the relationship table
2. **Identify Other Model**: Use `$relationship->getOtherModel($this)` to get the model on the other side of the relationship
3. **Get ID Field**: Use `$relationship->getModelIdField($otherModel)` to get the correct ID field name in the relationship table
4. **Retrieve Models**: Use `ModelFactory::retrieve()` to get actual model instances using the IDs from the relationship records
5. **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error handling and logging for failed retrievals

### Key Changes

```php
// OLD: Incorrect approach - treating relationship records as model records
foreach ($records as $record) {
    $instance = \Gravitycar\Factories\ModelFactory::new($relatedModelName);
    $instance->populateFromRow($record); // Wrong - $record is from join table
    $models[] = $instance;
}

// NEW: Correct approach - extract IDs and retrieve actual models
foreach ($records as $record) {
    $relatedModelId = $record[$relatedModelIDColumn];
    $instance = \Gravitycar\Factories\ModelFactory::retrieve($relatedModelName, $relatedModelId);
    if ($instance) {
        $models[] = $instance;
    }
}
```

## Test Results

### Test Script: `tmp/test_getRelatedModels.php`

✅ **All Tests Passing**:
- ✅ Retrieved movie 'f27e4e62-6022-490d-a651-d9ee966965e4' using `ModelFactory::retrieve()`
- ✅ Found 2 relationship records in join table (`rel_1_movies_M_movie_quotes`)
- ✅ Successfully retrieved 2 related Movie_Quote model instances
- ✅ Verified models are properly instantiated with correct IDs and quote text
- ✅ Relationship methods (`getOtherModel()`, `getModelIdField()`) working correctly

## Technical Details

### Relationship Table Structure
The test revealed the relationship table structure:
- **Table**: `rel_1_movies_M_movie_quotes`  
- **Movie ID Field**: `one_movies_id`
- **Quote ID Field**: `many_movie_quotes_id`

### Method Dependencies
The updated method relies on:
- `RelationshipBase::getOtherModel()` - Returns the model on the other side of the relationship
- `RelationshipBase::getModelIdField()` - Returns the ID field name for a specific model in the relationship table
- `ModelFactory::retrieve()` - Retrieves an existing model instance by ID

### Error Handling
- Validates relationship exists before processing
- Checks for required ID fields in relationship records
- Logs warnings for missing fields or failed retrievals
- Continues processing other records even if some fail
- Includes comprehensive error context in logs

## Impact

### Performance Considerations
- **More Expensive**: The updated method is more expensive than the previous version since it makes database calls to retrieve each related model
- **Accurate Data**: However, it provides accurate, fully-populated model instances instead of partially-populated objects with wrong data
- **Lazy Loading**: Only retrieves models when specifically requested via `getRelatedModels()`

### Backward Compatibility
- **API Compatible**: Method signature and return type unchanged
- **Behavior Improved**: Returns correct model instances instead of incorrectly populated ones
- **Error Resilient**: Better error handling prevents method from failing completely

## Files Modified

1. **`src/Models/ModelBase.php`**:
   - Updated `getRelatedModels()` method implementation
   - Added proper relationship record handling
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **`tmp/test_getRelatedModels.php`** (new):
   - Comprehensive test script validating the updated functionality
   - Tests with specific movie ID and relationship
   - Validates proper model instantiation and data access

## Usage Example

```php
// Retrieve a movie
$movie = ModelFactory::retrieve('Movies', $movieId);

// Get related movie quotes (correctly now)
$quotes = $movie->getRelatedModels('movies_movie_quotes');

// Each quote is now a properly instantiated Movie_Quote model
foreach ($quotes as $quote) {
    echo $quote->get('id');    // Correct ID
    echo $quote->get('quote'); // Correct quote text
}
```

## Validation Complete

The implementation has been tested and validated with real data, confirming that:
- Relationship table records are properly parsed
- Correct ID fields are identified and extracted
- Related model instances are successfully retrieved
- All model fields are accessible and contain correct data
- Error handling works as expected
