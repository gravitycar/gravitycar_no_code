# Phase 4 Implementation: Frontend Components - COMPLETED

## Overview
Phase 4 of the TMDB Integration implementation focuses on creating React/TypeScript frontend components that integrate with the TMDB search and enrichment functionality developed in previous phases.

## Completed Components

### 1. TMDBMovieSelector Component
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/movies/TMDBMovieSelector.tsx`

**Purpose**: Modal dialog for selecting from multiple TMDB movie matches when search returns multiple results.

**Key Features**:
- Responsive modal overlay with backdrop blur
- Movie card grid layout with poster thumbnails
- Selection highlighting and confirmation
- Keyboard navigation support (Escape to close)
- Accessible design with proper ARIA attributes
- Integration with existing UI design patterns

**Props**:
- `movies`: Array of TMDBMovie objects from search results
- `onSelect`: Callback when user selects a movie
- `onClose`: Callback when user cancels selection
- `isOpen`: Boolean to control modal visibility

### 2. VideoEmbed Component  
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/fields/VideoEmbed.tsx`

**Purpose**: Input field component for video URLs with validation and preview functionality.

**Key Features**:
- Support for YouTube and Vimeo URLs
- Real-time URL validation with visual feedback
- Optional preview toggle to show embedded video
- Automatic embed URL generation from various video URL formats
- Error handling for invalid URLs
- Responsive design with proper aspect ratios

**Props**:
- `value`: Current video URL value
- `onChange`: Callback when URL changes
- `label`: Field label text
- `showPreview`: Boolean to enable/disable preview functionality
- `className`: Additional CSS classes

### 3. MovieCreateForm Component
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/movies/MovieCreateForm.tsx`

**Purpose**: Enhanced movie creation/editing form with TMDB search integration.

**Key Features**:
- TMDB search with debounced title input (500ms delay)
- Automatic exact match application
- Multiple match selection via TMDBMovieSelector
- Form pre-population from TMDB data including:
  - Title, synopsis, release year
  - Poster URL, obscurity score, TMDB ID
- Video URL input with preview (VideoEmbed component)
- Manual field override capability
- Support for both create and edit modes via `initialData` prop
- Comprehensive form validation
- Loading states and error handling

**Props**:
- `onSave`: Callback with movie data when form is submitted
- `onCancel`: Callback when user cancels
- `isLoading`: Optional loading state for save operation
- `initialData`: Optional Movie object for edit mode

### 4. MovieListView Component
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/movies/MovieListView.tsx`

**Purpose**: Enhanced movie listing with grid/list views and TMDB integration indicators.

**Key Features**:
- Dual view modes: responsive grid and detailed table
- TMDB integration indicators (blue badge for TMDB-linked movies)
- Poster thumbnails with fallback placeholder
- Sorting options: title, release year, date added
- Ascending/descending sort order
- Inline edit/delete actions
- Trailer link display for movies with trailer URLs
- Obscurity score display
- Seamless integration with MovieCreateForm for CRUD operations
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state handling

**View Modes**:
- **Grid View**: Card-based layout with posters, ideal for browsing
- **List View**: Table format with detailed information, ideal for management

## Enhanced API Service Methods

### Added TMDB Integration Methods
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/services/api.ts`

1. **searchTMDB(title: string)**
   - Endpoint: `/movies/tmdb/search?title=${title}`
   - Returns TMDB search results with exact/partial matches

2. **enrichMovieWithTMDB(tmdbId: string)**
   - Endpoint: `/movies/tmdb/enrich/${tmdbId}`  
   - Returns enriched movie data from TMDB

## Type System Updates

### Movie Interface Enhancement
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/types/index.ts`

Added TMDB-related fields to Movie interface:
- `tmdb_id?: number` - TMDB external ID
- `trailer_url?: string` - Video URL for trailers
- `obscurity_score?: number` - Film obscurity rating (1-5)
- `release_year?: number` - Movie release year
- `poster_url?: string` - Full URL to poster image

### Component Type Definitions
- `TMDBMovie` interface for TMDB search results
- Enhanced `MovieCreateFormProps` with `initialData` support
- Proper TypeScript integration throughout all components

## Component Integration

### Export Structure
**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/movies/index.ts`
- Centralized exports for all movie-related components
- Clean import paths for consuming applications

**File**: `gravitycar-frontend/src/components/index.ts`
- Main component exports including movie components

## Testing Integration Points

All components are designed for comprehensive testing in Phase 6:

1. **Unit Testing Ready**:
   - Pure function props for easy mocking
   - Separated UI logic from API calls
   - Well-defined interfaces and prop types

2. **Integration Testing Ready**:
   - API service integration points clearly defined
   - Component interaction patterns established
   - State management patterns consistent

3. **E2E Testing Ready**:
   - Semantic HTML structure for reliable selectors
   - Proper loading states and error boundaries
   - User workflow paths clearly defined

## Performance Considerations

1. **Debounced Search**: 500ms debounce on TMDB title search prevents excessive API calls
2. **Lazy Loading**: Components only load when needed
3. **Image Optimization**: Poster images with fallback placeholders
4. **Responsive Design**: Grid/list views adapt to screen size

## Accessibility Features

1. **TMDB Selector Modal**:
   - Keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Focus management

2. **Form Components**:
   - Proper label associations
   - Error message announcements
   - Semantic form structure

3. **List Views**:
   - Screen reader friendly table headers
   - Alternative text for images
   - Action button labels

## Phase 4 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All planned frontend components have been implemented with:
- ✅ TMDB search integration
- ✅ Enhanced movie forms with auto-population
- ✅ Dual-view movie listing (grid/table)
- ✅ Video URL handling with preview
- ✅ TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility features
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

**Ready to proceed to Phase 5: Enhanced Movies API with validation and advanced features**
