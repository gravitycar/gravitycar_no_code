## State Management

### useGameState Hook
- **Purpose**: Centralized game state management and API integration
- **Key Features**:
  - Game lifecycle management (start, play, complete)
  - API integration with backend trivia endpoints
  - Error handling and loading states
  - High scores management
  - Navigation state control

**Hook Interface**:
```typescript
interface GameStateHookReturn {
  // Game State
  currentGame: TriviaGame | null;
  gamePhase: 'welcome' | 'playing' | 'complete' | 'high-scores';
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  currentQuestionIndex: number;

  // Game Actions
  startNewGame: () => Promise<void>;
  submitAnswer: (questionIndex: number, selectedOption: number) => Promise<void>;
  completeGame: () => Promise<void>;
  resetGame: () => void;

  // Navigation Actions
  showHighScores: () => void;
  returnToWelcome: () => void;

  // High Scores
  highScores: TriviaHighScore[];
  fetchHighScores: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

## API Integration

### Trivia Endpoints Used
1. **POST /trivia/start-game** - Start new game session
2. **PUT /trivia/answer** - Submit answer for question
3. **PUT /trivia/complete-game/{gameId}** - Complete game session
4. **GET /trivia/high-scores** - Fetch leaderboard data

### Data Transformation
- Backend API responses are transformed to match frontend TypeScript interfaces
- Game questions are processed to extract movie options from complex API structure
- High scores are ranked and formatted for display

## TypeScript Interfaces

### Core Game Types
```typescript
interface TriviaGame {
  id: string;
  score: number;
  totalQuestions: number;
  questions: TriviaQuestion[];
  startTime: string;
  endTime: string | null;
  isComplete: boolean;
}

interface TriviaQuestion {
  id: string;
  quote: string;
  character?: string;
  correctAnswer: string;
  options: string[];
  answered?: boolean;
  correct?: boolean;
  timeTaken?: number;
}

interface TriviaHighScore {
  id: string;
  playerName: string;
  score: number;
  accuracy: number;
  totalQuestions: number;
  correctAnswers: number;
  timeElapsed: number;
  dateCompleted: string;
  rank: number;
}
```

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme**: Blue/purple gradient theme with accent colors
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Layout**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and feedback animations

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear indication of game progress
- **Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Button and option hover states
- **Click Feedback**: Visual confirmation of selections
- **Disabled States**: Clear indication when interactions are disabled
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars and completion indicators

## Game Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: User sees instructions and starts game
2. **Question Display**: Each question shows quote with multiple choice options
3. **Answer Submission**: User selects answer, gets immediate feedback
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress through all 15 questions
5. **Game Completion**: Final score display with statistics breakdown
6. **High Scores**: Option to view leaderboard
7. **Replay**: Easy restart or return to home

## Performance Considerations

- **Component Optimization**: React functional components with proper hooks usage
- **State Management**: Centralized state to avoid prop drilling
- **API Efficiency**: Minimal API calls with proper caching
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Non-blocking UI updates

## Integration with Backend

The frontend successfully integrates with the existing Gravitycar Framework backend:
- Uses TriviaGameAPIController endpoints
- Handles Movie_Quote_Trivia_Games and Movie_Quote_Trivia_Questions models
- Processes complex movie option data structure
- Manages game sessions and scoring

## Next Steps (Phase 4 & 5)

1. **Navigation Integration**: Add trivia game to main application navigation
2. **User Authentication**: Integrate with existing auth system for personalized scores
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all components and game flow
4. **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading
5. **Enhanced Features**: Categories, difficulty levels, multiplayer support

## Technical Notes

- All components are TypeScript-based for type safety
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling with responsive design
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Component organization following React best practices
