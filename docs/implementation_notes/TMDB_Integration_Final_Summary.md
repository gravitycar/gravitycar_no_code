## Technical Accomplishments

### Backend Services Implemented
1. **TMDBApiService**: Low-level TMDB API communication with rate limiting and error handling
2. **MovieTMDBIntegrationService**: High-level integration logic with search matching and data enrichment
3. **TMDBController**: RESTful API endpoints for frontend consumption

### Frontend Components Implemented
1. **TMDBMovieSelector**: Responsive modal for movie selection with card-based layout
2. **VideoEmbed**: Video URL validation and preview with YouTube/Vimeo support
3. **MovieCreateForm**: Enhanced form with debounced search and auto-population
4. **MovieListView**: Grid/list view toggle with TMDB integration indicators

### API Endpoints Delivered
- `GET /movies/tmdb/search?title={title}` - Search for movies with match classification
- `POST /movies/tmdb/enrich` - Enrich movie data from TMDB ID

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Intelligent Movie Search**: Exact match detection, partial matching, and no-match handling
2. **Data Enrichment**: Synopsis, poster URLs, trailer URLs, release year, and obscurity scoring
3. **Title Normalization**: Case-insensitive matching with punctuation and space handling
4. **Frontend Integration**: Debounced search, selection modals, and automatic data population

## Test Coverage Summary

### Unit Test Coverage
- **MovieTMDBIntegrationService**: 6 tests covering search logic, enrichment, and title normalization
- **TMDBApiService**: 9 tests covering API communication, URL building, and data processing
- **TMDBController**: 6 tests covering endpoint registration and response formatting

### Integration Test Coverage
- **MoviesModel Integration**: 5 tests covering database operations and TMDB data persistence
- **API Route Registration**: Endpoint availability and proper routing
- **Data Flow**: End-to-end data flow from API to database

### Feature Test Coverage
- **API Endpoint Testing**: 6 comprehensive tests covering complete workflows
- **Data Validation**: Structure validation for all TMDB-enriched data
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses and edge case handling

## Performance Metrics
