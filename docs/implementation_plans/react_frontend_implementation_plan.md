- **Context API**: Authentication, theme, and global app state
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate data fetching and business logic
- **URL State**: Filters, pagination, and navigation state

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Auth Context Provider
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  isLoading: boolean;
  login: (credentials: LoginCredentials) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  refreshToken: () => Promise<void>;
}

// Protected Route Component
<ProtectedRoute requiredPermission="users.list">
  <UsersPage />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### 6.2 API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Custom hook for data fetching
const useUsers = (filters?: UserFilters, pagination?: Pagination) => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Implementation using Gravitycar API
  // GET /api/Users with pagination and filtering
};

// Component usage
const UsersPage = () => {
  const { users, loading, error, refetch } = useUsers();
  // Render logic
};
```

### 6.3 Metadata-Driven Forms
```typescript
// Dynamic form generation
const ModelForm = ({ modelName, recordId, onSuccess }) => {
  const { metadata } = useModelMetadata(modelName);
  const { createRecord, updateRecord } = useModelCRUD(modelName);
  
  // Generate form fields based on metadata
  return (
    <form>
      {metadata.fields.map(field => (
        <FieldComponent key={field.name} field={field} />
      ))}
    </form>
  );
};
```
