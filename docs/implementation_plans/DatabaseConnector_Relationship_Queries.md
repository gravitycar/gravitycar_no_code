# DatabaseConnector Relationship Query Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Feature Overview
Enhance the DatabaseConnector class to support querying across model relationships, allowing complex JOIN operations and criteria filtering on related models. This will eliminate the need for custom SQL in model classes like `Movie_Quote_Trivia_Questions::selectRandomMovieQuote()` by providing a standardized way to query across relationships.

## Requirements Summary
The current implementation requires writing custom SQL for queries that span relationships. We need to add support for:
- Joining tables based on relationship definitions
- Applying criteria on relationship join tables
- Applying criteria on related model fields
- Maintaining backwards compatibility with existing find() operations

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components
1. **RelationshipBase Classes**: Already exist with basic structure
2. **DatabaseConnector::find()**: Handles simple criteria on single models
3. **DatabaseConnector::applyCriteria()**: Current implementation for basic field criteria
4. **ModelBase::getRelationships()**: Available for accessing relationship metadata
5. **DatabaseConnector::joinCounter**: Exists for managing unique join aliases

### Gap Analysis
1. **Missing getOtherModel() methods** in relationship classes
2. **No relationship-aware criteria handling** in DatabaseConnector
3. **No support for dot-notation criteria** (relationship.field)
4. **No automatic JOIN generation** based on relationship metadata
5. **No getRandomRecord() method** for single record retrieval with relationships

## Design Architecture

### 1. Relationship Enhancement
Each relationship class needs a `getOtherModel()` method to determine the related model based on the current model context.

### 2. Criteria Format Enhancement
Support three criteria formats:
- `'field_name'` → Direct field on current model
- `'relationship_name.field_name'` → Field on relationship join table
- `'relationship_name.related_model_name.field_name'` → Field on related model

### 3. DatabaseConnector Method Structure
```
DatabaseConnector::getRandomRecord()
├── Uses enhanced find() with relationship support
├── Applies LIMIT 1 and ORDER BY RAND()
└── Returns single record ID

DatabaseConnector::applyCriteria() (refactored)
├── Analyzes criteria key format (dot count)
├── Groups criteria by type to prevent redundant JOINs
├── Routes to appropriate handler:
│   ├── applyModelCriteria() (0 dots)
│   ├── applyRelationshipCriteria() (1 dot)
│   └── applyRelatedModelCriteria() (2 dots)
└── Manages JOIN operations and aliases
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Relationship Base Enhancement
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. **Add getOtherModel() to RelationshipBase**
   - Create abstract method signature
   - Document expected behavior for each relationship type

2. **Implement getOtherModel() in OneToOneRelationship**
   - Compare passed model with modelA and modelB
   - Return the opposite model instance

3. **Implement getOtherModel() in ManyToManyRelationship**
   - Compare passed model with modelA and modelB
   - Return the opposite model instance

4. **Implement getOtherModel() in OneToManyRelationship**
   - Compare passed model with modelMany and modelOne
   - Return the opposite model instance

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/Relationships/RelationshipBase.php`
- `src/Relationships/OneToOneRelationship.php`
- `src/Relationships/ManyToManyRelationship.php`
- `src/Relationships/OneToManyRelationship.php`

### Phase 2: DatabaseConnector Core Enhancement
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours

1. **Add getRandomRecord() method**
   - Wrapper around find() with LIMIT 1 and ORDER BY RAND()
   - Returns single record ID or null
   - Supports all relationship criteria formats

2. **Refactor applyCriteria() method**
   - Change signature to include ModelBase parameter
   - Sort all criteria into three arrays based on format (dot count)
   - Call specialized methods with grouped criteria arrays
   - Maintain backwards compatibility

3. **Implement applyModelCriteria() method**
   - Handle direct field criteria (existing logic) for multiple fields
   - Validate fields exist on model using hasField()
   - Apply WHERE conditions as current implementation

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/Database/DatabaseConnector.php`

### Phase 3: Relationship Criteria Handlers
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

1. **Implement applyRelationshipCriteria() method**
   - Parse multiple relationship criteria to group by relationship name
   - Get relationship objects from model using getRelationship()
   - Generate unique aliases and track them to prevent duplicate JOINs
   - Add JOINs for relationship tables (only once per relationship)
   - Apply WHERE conditions on relationship fields
   - Validate fields exist on relationships using hasField()

2. **Implement applyRelatedModelCriteria() method**
   - Parse multiple related model criteria to group by relationship and related model
   - Get relationship objects from model and related models using relationship.getOtherModel()
   - Generate unique aliases and track them to prevent duplicate JOINs
   - Add JOINs for both relationship and related model tables (only once per relationship)
   - Apply WHERE conditions on related model fields
   - Validate fields exist on related models using hasField()

3. **Enhance JOIN management**
   - Track joined tables using static variables to avoid duplicate JOINs across method calls
   - Ensure proper ON clause construction based on relationship metadata
   - Handle different relationship types appropriately
   - Implement JOIN deduplication at the relationship and related model level

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/Database/DatabaseConnector.php`

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

1. **Update existing find() method**
   - Pass ModelBase instance to applyCriteria()
   - Ensure backwards compatibility with existing code
   - Update all find() callers if needed

2. **Optimize JOIN operations**
   - Prevent duplicate JOINs for same relationship
   - Optimize alias naming for readability
   - Handle complex relationship chains

3. **Update Movie_Quote_Trivia_Questions model**
   - Replace custom SQL with DatabaseConnector::getRandomRecord()
   - Use new criteria format for relationship queries

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/Database/DatabaseConnector.php`
- `src/Models/movie_quote_trivia_questions/Movie_Quote_Trivia_Questions.php`

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. **Relationship getOtherModel() tests**
   - Test each relationship type returns correct model

## Target Usage Example

With this implementation, the Movie Quote Trivia Questions example would work like this:

```php
// Instead of custom SQL:
SELECT mq.id FROM movie_quotes mq 
JOIN movies m ON mq.movie_id = m.id 
WHERE mq.deleted_at IS NULL 
AND m.deleted_at IS NULL 
AND mq.movie_id IS NOT NULL

// You could use:
$criteria = [
    'deleted_at' => null,
    'movie_id' => '__NOT_NULL__',
    'movies_movie_quotes.movies.deleted_at' => null
];
$parameters = ['orderBy' => ['id' => 'RAND()'], 'limit' => 1];
$randomRecord = $db->getRandomRecord($movieQuoteModel, $criteria, ['id'], $parameters);
```

This approach ensures optimal SQL generation with proper JOIN deduplication and maintains the flexibility of the criteria-based system while supporting complex relationship queries.
