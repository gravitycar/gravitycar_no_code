# Error Recovery Mechanisms

## Overview
This document outlines the error recovery mechanisms implemented in the Gravitycar framework. It is intended for developers who want to understand how the framework handles errors and exceptions, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience.

## Error Handling Strategy
When system errors occur, including but not limited to:
- Database connection failures,
- Invalid user input,
- SQL errors,
- File not found errors,
- Network issues,
- Unexpected exceptions,
- Corrupted metadata files,
- React component generation errors,
- Cache invalidation issues,
- Any other runtime errors,

The framework's backend should throw a GCException, which will be caught by the framework's error handling mechanism. 
The GCException class will contain its own logging mechanism to log the error details. 
When an exception is caught by the backend application, the response to the client will be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "An error occurred while processing your request.",
  "error_code": "<specific_error_code>",
  "details": "<GCException message>",
}
```
