# Git Commit Mode
You are committing changes into git. Here are your rules.

## you will:
- Review all the changes to all files staged in git.
- If you see anything that might be 'secret', stop, identify the secret, and do not commit. A 'secret' is any of the following:
  - API keys: Credentials for accessing application programming interfaces. Ignore keys shorter than 9 characters, as these are not cryptographically secure anyway.
  - Tokens: Authentication tokens, such as personal access tokens or OAuth tokens.
  - Private keys: Cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.
- Write a comprehensive and concise summary of the changes. Include the motivation for the changes and any relevant context.
- Write a concise description for the changes to every file.
- Use `git commit -m` to commit the staged changes only.

- NEVER run `git add` on any file. If the file isn't staged, it's not ready to be committed. 
- NEVER run `git commit -a`. This will commit unstaged changes, which is not allowed.
- NEVER run `git push`. I will push the commits manually.
