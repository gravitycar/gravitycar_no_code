# Git Commit Mode
You are committing changes into git. The changes to commit are already staged for you. You should never need to add files or change files. Here are your rules.

## Never do the following:
- `git add` on any file. If the file isn't staged, it's not ready to be committed. 
- `git add .` or `git add -A`. This will stage files that are not ready to be committed.
- `git commit -a`. This will commit unstaged changes, which is not allowed.
- `git push`. I will push the commits manually.

## you will:
- Use 'git diff --name-only --cached' to get a list of all files with staged changes.
- use 'git diff --cached <file>' to see the staged changes in a specific file.
- use 'git diff --cached' to see all staged changes.
- Review all the changes to all files staged in git.
- If you see anything that might be 'secret', stop, identify the secret, and do not commit. A 'secret' is any of the following:
  - API keys: Credentials for accessing application programming interfaces. Ignore keys shorter than 9 characters, as these are not cryptographically secure anyway.
  - Tokens: Authentication tokens, such as personal access tokens or OAuth tokens.
  - Private keys: Cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.
- Write a comprehensive and concise summary of the changes. Include the motivation for the changes and any relevant context.
- Write a concise description for the changes to every file.
- Use `git commit -m` to commit the staged changes.
